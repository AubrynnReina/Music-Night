# Music-Night

This is a fun project I did for my friend group's music night.

The idea is that each friend will send me musical youtube links and I make a playlist out of them with a hand-made shuffling method that ensure that no one's list is going to finish too soon.

Let's say 5 people send me 4 songs each I can make sure that the last 5 songs will be from each person's list and I can expand that list to 10 last songs being 2 random songs from each person's list.
